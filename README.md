# turtle-flower-generator
Repl provides another Python environment that has partial support for a graphics module
called “Turtle Graphics”. Create a new “Python with Turtle” repl and then watch this
complete Python Turtle graphics overview.
Task:
Write a series of step-by-step instructions to reproduce the above shape.

Outcome:
In the context of the title – you can see that the flower-shape involves a repetition of the
same “petal” a number of times, about a centralised point. Thus, if you knew how to
generate a single petal, and to rotate around the same corner, then the task of repeating
it a number of times becomes trivial. You have recognised a fundamental pattern.
Pattern recognition isn’t just graphical – it also involves more complicated thinking. You
did this earlier when you fleshed out the details of an algorithm identifying palindromes.
When you identify commonalities in experiences, you can extract those patterns allowing
you to create a general idea of the problem and how to solve it.
These concepts also extend to programming “patterns”, its an area called “design
patterns”.
